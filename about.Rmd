Welcome! My name is Katie. I teach statistics and data science at Brigham Young University - Idaho. I love math, all genres of books, sunshine, food, and any combination thereof (such as [math + pizza](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-TBlh44gY.))

The name "Backyard Statistics" is a reference to John Tukey's famous quote:

*"The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone's backyard."*

Besides the usual interpretation (that statistics can be used in any field of work) I also enjoy the visual it brings to mind: a group of statisticians, dressed in their best explorer outfits, eagerly digging a hole in the backyard to unearth a significant trend or insight. As Calvin says, "There's treasure everywhere!"

This blog acts as a backyard for me to explore in, make mistakes, learn new things, and keep my enthusiasm for playing with statistics.
