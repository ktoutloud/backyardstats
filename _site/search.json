      "contents": "\r\nWelcome! My name is Katie. I teach statistics and data science classes at Brigham Young University - Idaho. I love math, classic literature, sunshine, food, and any combination thereof. (math + pizza)\r\nThe name “Backyard Statistics” is a reference to John Tukey’s famous quote:\r\nThe best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone’s backyard.\r\nBesides the usual interpretation (that statistics can be used in any field of work) I also enjoy the visual it brings to mind: a group of statisticians, dressed in their best explorer outfits, eagerly digging a hole in the backyard to unearth a significant trend or insight. As Calvin says, “There’s treasure everywhere!”\r\n\r\nThis blog acts as a backyard for me to explore in, make mistakes, learn new things, and keep my enthusiasm for playing with statistics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
