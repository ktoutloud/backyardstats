I love math, all genres of books, sunshine, food, and any combination thereof (such as math + pizza)\r\nThe name “Backyard Statistics” is a reference to John Tukey’s famous quote:\r\n“The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone’s backyard.”\r\nBesides the usual interpretation (that statistics can be used in any field of work) I also enjoy the visual it brings to mind: a group of statisticians, dressed in their best explorer outfits, eagerly digging a hole in the backyard to unearth a significant trend or insight. As Calvin says, “There’s treasure everywhere!”\r\nThis blog acts as a backyard for me to explore in, make mistakes, learn new things, and keep my enthusiasm for playing with statistics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
