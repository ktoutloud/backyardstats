This year at BYU's Summer Institute of Applied Statistics [Dr. Garrett Grolemund](https://resources.rstudio.com/authors/garrett-grolemund) held a two-day workshop on the tidyverse and reproducible research. I started using the tidyverse at work last year. I am comfortable with the tools, but it was still wonderful to have them taught in one comprehensive setting. Garrett is a talented instructor, so as a bonus I also picked up a lot of teaching tips!

During the workshop we often used the `babynames` dataset for our examples. After analyzing my own name in every way possible, I began to look at the names of Stranger Things characters. The result was a fun little analysis that feels worth sharing. You've already finished watching season 3. What else is there to do but troll the internet and read my blog post?

## Popular baby names

Similar to [this article](https://www.vulture.com/2016/07/stranger-things-80s-names.html), I was interested in how appropriate character names in Stranger Things are for a show set in the 80s. We can answer this question by calculating the popularity of names over time. We'll look specifically at the names Mike, Dustin, Lucas, Will, Jane (Eleven), and Max.

We begin by loading the `tidyverse` and `babynames` packages. The `babynames` dataset comes from the Social Security Administration (SSA) and contains information on names from 1880 to 2017.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(babynames)
rmarkdown::paged_table(head(babynames))
```

How do we calculate popularity? The dataset already provides the column `prop` which contains "proportions of people of that gender with that name born in that year". We can rank names by proportion, and use the rank to compare popularity from year to year.

Note that I'm using the longer versions of names when available, such as Michael for Mike. I've also included the name Jane since the name Eleven only appears once in the data (7 female babies in the year 2017).

```{r}
strange <- babynames %>%
  group_by(year, sex) %>%
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(prop))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter((sex == "M" & name %in% c("Michael","Dustin","Lucas","William")) |
           (sex == "F" & name %in% c("Jane","Maxine")))
rmarkdown::paged_table(head(strange))
```

## How strange are names in Stranger Things?

According to the [Stranger Things Wiki](https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Stranger_Things_Wiki) Mike, Dustin, Lucas, Will, Eleven, and Max were all born in 1971. What was their name rank that year?

```{r}
rmarkdown::paged_table(strange %>% filter(year==1971))
```

To put this in perspective, there were `r nrow(babynames %>% filter(year==1971 & sex=="M") %>% distinct(name))` male names and `r nrow(babynames %>% filter(year==1971 & sex=="F") %>% distinct(name))` female names in 1971. Our character name ranks range from #1 to #749 that same year. These seem like realistic names for teenagers in the 1980s!

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# We can also look at the cumulative proportion for each rank to see just how strange Lucas is at #579 and Maxine at #749.

names1971 <- babynames %>%
  filter(year==1971) %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(prop))) %>%
  arrange(rank, prop) %>%
  mutate(cumulative_prop = cumsum(prop)) %>%
  ungroup()

names1971 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=rank, y=cumulative_prop, col=sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title="Cumulative Proportion of 1971 Babies by Name Rank", x="Rank", y="Cumulative Proportion", col="Sex")

# This graph helps us realize that female names are more diverse than male names (at least in 1971). It take fewer male names to reach a given cumulative proportion than it does female names. 
# 
# If we look at the names Lucas and Maxine specifically we see that the 579th highest ranked male names account for 90.7% of male babies, while the 749th highest ranked female names account for only 83.2% of female babies.

names1971 %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  filter(name %in% c("Lucas","Maxine")) %>% 
  filter(rank == min(rank))
```

How do the name ranks for these characters change over time?

```{r}
library(plotly)
p <- strange %>%
  filter(year >= 1950) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=rank, p=prop, col=name)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_vline(xintercept=1971,col="grey80",linetype="dashed") +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "reverse") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title="Popularity of Stranger Things names",
       x="Year", y="Rank", col="Name")
ggplotly(p, tooltip = c('colour','x','y','p'))
```

One reason I chose to analyze ranks instead of proportions is for interpretability. If I told you the name Michael ranged in proportion from 3.8% to 4.5% during the 1970s, what would that mean to you? Now what if I told you that Michael was the #1 male baby name for the entire 1970s? And 1980s? In fact, Michael is #1 from 1961 to 1998.

The strangest names are Lucas and Maxine. Maxine has a lower rank (#749 vs. #579) but Lucas has the lower proportion (0.0109% vs. 0.0112%).

## Stranger actors with stranger names

We can do the same type of analysis for the actors in Stranger Things. Finn, Gaten, and Sadie were born in 2002. Noah and Millie were born in 2004, and Caleb was born in 2001. To make this easy on ourselves let's look at their name ranks in the same year, 2000.

```{r}
strange <- babynames %>%
  group_by(year, sex) %>%
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(prop))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter((sex == "M" & name %in% c("Finn", "Gaten","Caleb", "Noah")) |
           (sex == "F" & name %in% c("Millie", "Sadie")))
rmarkdown::paged_table(strange %>% filter(year==2000))
```
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
strange <- babynames %>%
  group_by(year, sex) %>%
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(prop))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter((sex == "M" & name %in% c("Michael", "Finn", "Dustin", "Gaten", "Lucas", "Caleb", "William", "Noah")) |
           (sex == "F" & name %in% c("Jane", "Millie", "Maxine", "Sadie"))) %>%
  mutate(group = case_when(
    name %in% c("Michael","Dustin","Lucas","William","Jane","Maxine") ~ "Character",
    TRUE ~ "Actor")) %>%
  mutate(pair = case_when(
    name %in% c("Michael","Finn") ~ "Mike/Finn",
    name %in% c("Dustin","Gaten") ~ "Dustin/Gaten",
    name %in% c("Lucas","Caleb") ~ "Lucas/Caleb",
    name %in% c("William","Noah") ~ "Will/Noah",
    name %in% c("Jane","Millie") ~ "Jane/Millie",
    name %in% c("Maxine","Sadie") ~ "Maxine/Sadie",
    TRUE ~ "ERROR"))
```

Again, we can plot the ranks over time to see what trends were happening when these actors where born.

```{r}
p <- strange %>%
  filter(year >= 1950) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=rank, p=prop, col=name)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_vline(xintercept=2000,col="grey80",linetype="dashed") +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "reverse") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title="Popularity of actor names",
       x="Year", y="Rank", col="Name") +
  geom_point(aes(x=1998, y=7557, col="Gaten"))
ggplotly(p, tooltip = c('colour','x','y','p'))
```

Looks like all the names were increasing in popularity in 2000! All but Gaten, that is. The name Gaten appears only once in 1998 with 7 male babies.

## What's in a name?

I used this quick analysis to practice the tidyverse tools from Garrett's workshop. What else could I have done? How would you define a "strange" baby name using this data? Let me know, and maybe I'll post a part 2!

```{r include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = filter(strange, year >= 1960)) +
  geom_line(aes(x=year, y=rank, group=name, col=pair)) +
  geom_point(aes(x=year, y=rank, col=group, shape=group)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept=2002,col="red") +
   geom_vline(xintercept=1971,col="red") +
    scale_y_continuous(trans = "reverse") +
  facet_grid(pair ~ .) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title="Names of Stranger Things characters",
      x="Year", y="Number of Babies")
```
