<p>Last month I attended ASA’s <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/csp/2019/">Conference for Statistical Practice (CSP)</a> in New Orleans. I’ve attended conferences before but always had the security of either 1) going with friends or 2) being at a local conference so I could leave whenever I wanted/needed and go straight home.</p>
<p>CSP was the first conference I attended without my safety nets. Besides realizing that Hadley Wickham says “lay-tek” and not “luh-tek”, here are some other things I learned that might be helpful for other mega-shy, mega-introverted, but also mega-nerdy-and-wants-to-attend-conferences young professionals (I know I’m not alone).</p>

<p><strong>Conserve energy.</strong> Before the conference, make sure you get enough sleep. Eat right. Do things to reach a calm/happy state. Store up some social energy, because you will have to be brave and actually talk to people!</p>
<p><strong>Sit by people.</strong> If you are attending a presentation alone, sit by someone else who is alone. Shake their hand, smile, and introduce yourself. There, you did it. You can spend the rest of the presentation in total silence, proud of that small moment.</p>
<p><strong>Ask dumb questions.</strong> I often get stuck in a mindset where I only want to ask smart, deep, technical questions. Why? Because everyone else seems to know what’s going on, and if I say “Oh, I’ve never heard of xyz and I don’t understand what you’re talking about” then the whole world will know I’m a fraud!!! <em>Gasp.</em> Deep breath, take a step back. We go to conferences to learn new things! Go ahead and ask the dumb questions.</p>
<p><strong>Ask soft questions.</strong> If someone’s work is way over your head and you can’t even think of dumb questions, then ask “soft” questions. Meaning, it’s ok to be interested in the people and not their projects. At one poster I stopped at, the woman presenting mentioned that she had run <em>a lot</em> of simulations to test her tuning parameters. Something in her tone caught my attention and reminded me of my master’s thesis. Instead of stressing out trying to think of an technical question to ask, I simply said “So…how many simulations did your advisor make you run?”. She laughed and instantly loosened up. “Oh! It never quits! Every time I show him my results he has another idea I have to test.” I shared similar experiences I had grad school, and we totally bonded. Then I walked away and high fived myself for speaking more than 3 word to someone.</p>

<p><strong>Join group activities.</strong> This one is easy! Conferences will often organize group activities such as dinners and tours to explore the town. All you have to do sign up, show up, and follow the crowd. Talking not required.</p>
<p>And that’s it! I really did enjoy CSP, and loved seeing how statistics is being used outside of my own field. If you have any tips for navigating/participating in a professional community as an introvert, I’d love to hear them!</p>
