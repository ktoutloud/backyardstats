This week I learned that the `quantile` function in R has nine different methods for calculating quantiles. This caused a bit of confusion at work when I needed to match summaries from SAS. (Admittedly, I get confused every time I have to match R and SAS output.)


Here's an example of the 9 methods (default is #7).

```{r cars}
values <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
sapply(1:9, function(x) quantile(values, probs = c(0.25, .5, 0.75), type = x))
```

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile#Estimating_quantiles_from_a_sample) has a nice table that shows how the methods line up between R, SAS, Maple, Stata, ScipPy, Julia and even Excel.

[This pdf](https://tolstoy.newcastle.edu.au/R/e17/help/att-1067/Quartiles_in_R.pdf) from the R mailing list archives is also useful and gives examples with several different data sets.
