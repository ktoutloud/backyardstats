My name is Katie. I am a statistician working in Salt Lake City, Utah. I love math, classic literature, sunshine, food, and any combination thereof. [(math + pizza)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-TBlh44gY)

The name “Backyard Statistics” is a reference to John Tukey’s famous quote:

*The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone’s backyard.*

Besides the usual interpretation (that statistics can be used in any field of work) I also enjoy the visual it brings to mind: a group of statisticians, dressed in their best safari outfits, eagerly digging a hole in the backyard to unearth a dinosaur or a significant p-value.

This blog acts as a backyard for me to explore in, make mistakes, learn new things, and keep my enthusiasm for playing with statistics.
